        description:
          short: Maximum allowed yaw rate for the rover.
          long: |
            This parameter is used to cap desired yaw rates and map controller inputs to desired yaw rates in acro mode.
        type: float
        unit: deg/s
        min: 0.01
        max: 1000

      RM_MAX_YAW_ACCEL:
        description:
          short: Maximum allowed yaw acceleration for the rover
          long: |
            This parameter is used to cap desired yaw acceleration. This is used to adjust incoming yaw rate setpoints
            to a feasible yaw rate setpoint based on the physical limitation on how fast the yaw rate can change.
            This leads to a smooth setpoint trajectory for the closed loop yaw rate controller to track.
            Set to -1 to disable.
        type: float
        unit: deg/s^2
        min: -1
        max: 1000

      RM_MAX_THR_YAW_R:
        description:
          short: Yaw rate turning left/right wheels at max speed in opposite directions
          long: |
            This parameter is used to calculate the feedforward term of the closed loop yaw rate control.
            The controller first calculates the required speed difference between the left and right motor to achieve the desired yaw rate.
            This desired speed difference is then linearly mapped to normalized motor commands.
            A good starting point is twice the speed the rover drives at maximum throttle (RM_MAX_THRTL_SPD)).
            Increase this parameter if the rover turns faster than the setpoint, and decrease if the rover turns slower.
        type: float

      RM_MAX_THR_SPD:
        description:
          short: Speed the rover drives at maximum throttle
          long: |
            This parameter is used to calculate the feedforward term of the closed loop speed control which linearly
            maps desired speeds to normalized motor commands [-1. 1].
            A good starting point is the observed ground speed when the rover drives at maximum throttle in manual mode.

            Maximum decelaration is used to limit the deceleration of the rover.

            Caution: Disabling the deceleration limit also disables the slow down effect in auto modes.

        description:
          short: Tuning parameter for the velocity reduction during waypoint transition
          long: |
            The waypoint transition speed is calculated as:
            Transition_speed = Maximum_speed * (1 - normalized_transition_angle * RM_MISS_VEL_GAIN)
